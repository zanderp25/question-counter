## About

Have you ever lost track of how many questions you have answered and which one to do next? Look no further!

This program is a simple question counter. It will count the number of questions you have answered, the number of questions you have left to answer, and gives the current problem that you are working on. (Future versions will also give you a list of questions you have left to answer and a percentage of how many questions you have left to answer.)

## How To Use

This app is unfinished so im not gonna write anything here :smiling_imp:

## Download

You can [download](https://github.com/zanderp25/question-counter/releases/) the latest installable version of Question for Windows, macOS and Linux. (Soon, not yet)
